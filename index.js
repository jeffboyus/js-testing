/*
* Objective:
* Create a library that takes in a phone number format
* that could have any combination of letter, numbers or special characters
* and converts it to a more human readable 10-digit format "(509) 555-1234".
*
* Input examples:
*   "509/5551234" or "5095551234" or "509.555.1234" or "509-555-1234" etc.
*
* Requirements:
*   - For this library, we are only concerned with United States formatted numbers, no dial codes
*   - All code shall be in ES5 syntax (thanks IE and Safari)
*   - Errors should be thrown with reason messages, as needed
*   - You shall only except string or number data types as your input (test provided)
*   - You shall only return a string datatype (test provided)
*   - You may use RegEx if you wish, but you must be able to write test cases for it
*   - You may write any number of helper functions, but they must be testable as well
*   - You shall not use any imports/require statements in this library, nor pass in
*     helper objects to the original function
*
*   ALL Node modules you may need to write this library are already included.
